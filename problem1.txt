What does the assembly code do?
-------------------------------
All of the commands end with q because we are dealing with a quadword of memory
Line 1: The assembly code first moves the value of x into register %rax
Line 2: It multiplies x * 3 and stores in %rax
Line 3: It adds 12 to (x * 3) and stores that in %rax
Line 4: Multiplies (x * 3 + 12) * x and stores that in %rax
Line 5: Subtracts 17 from (3x^2 + 12x) and stores result in %rax
Final values stored in %rax is 3x^2 + 12x - 17
