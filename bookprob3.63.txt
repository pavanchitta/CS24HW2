Answer to Problem 3.63, CS:APP3e pp.314-315
-------------------------------------------
From the jump table, we can see that there are 6 quadwords of memory,
and thus we will need 6 switch cases.

The switch statement will start corresponding to line 5 of the machine
code. This says to jump to a line according to the value that is stored
in %rsi, which corresponds to n - 60 in decimal.

The first statement, if (n - 60) = 0, will point to line 6 based on the jump
table and will set %rax = x * 8, and then will return the value in %rax.

The second statement, if (n - 60) = 1, will correspond to a jump to line
17 and will set %rax = x + 75 in decimal. Then it will return.

The third statement, if (n - 60) = 2, will correspond to a jump to line
6 again  and will set %rax = x * 8 in decimal. Then it will return.

The fourth statement, if (n - 60) = 3, will correspond to a jump to line
9 and will set %rax = x >> 3, by arithmetic right shifting three times
. Then it will return.

The fifth statement, if (n - 60) = 4, will correspond to a jump to line
12, and will set %rax = x << 4, by left shifting four times. Then it will
subtract %rax = %rax - x. Then it will set %rdi = %rax. Then it will multiply
%rdi = %rdi * %rdi and then it will load %rax = rdi + 75. If rdi initially had
x this corresponds to doing %rax = (x*2^4 - x)*(x*2^4 - x) + 75.

The sixth statement, if (n - 60) = 5, will correspond to a jump to the line 16
and will load %rax = x * x + 75.

In the default case (given by the ja statement), we will set %rax = x + 75.

Since many of these cases overlap, the c switch block will allow cases
to fall through to other overlapping cases. Using this, we can build the c
code as follows:

long switch_prob( long x, long n)
{
    /*
     * x in %rdi, n in %rsi
     */
    long result;
    switch(n - 60)
    {
        /* Fall through, n - 60 = 0 */
        case 0:
        /* n - 60 = 2 */
        case 2:
            result = x * 8;
            break;
        /* n - 60 = 3 */
        case 3:
            result = x >> 3;
            break;
        /* n - 60 = 4 */
        case 4:
            result = (x << 4) - x;
        /* let it fall through to case 5 */
        /* n - 60 = 5 */
        case 5:
            x *= x;
        /* Fall through */
        case 1:
        /* Fall through */
        default:
            result = x + 75;
    }
    return result;
}
